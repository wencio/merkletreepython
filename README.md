Here is an implementation of a Merkle Tree in Python:
This implementation uses the SHA-256 hash function to calculate the hashes of the transactions and nodes in the tree. The final result is stored in the parents list, which is the root node of the Merkle Tree.
There are several advantages to using a Merkle Tree for transactions:

Verification Efficiency: With a Merkle Tree, it is possible to verify the authenticity of a transaction without having to go through every transaction in the tree. This significantly reduces the amount of time and computational power required for verification.

Tamper Detection: Merkle Trees allow for easy detection of any changes made to the transactions. If any transaction is altered, the resulting hash will be different and the change can be easily detected.

Space Efficiency: Merkle Trees use a hash-based structure, which allows for the compression of large amounts of data into a single root hash. This results in a more space-efficient method of storing and verifying transactions.

Scalability: Merkle Trees can be easily scaled to handle large amounts of transactions by simply adding more levels to the tree.

Security: Merkle Trees provide a secure method of verifying transactions as the hashes are computationally difficult to reverse or alter. This makes it an effective tool in securing transactions and safeguarding against fraud and tampering.
